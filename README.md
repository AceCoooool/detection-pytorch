# detection-pytorch
This repository is my reproduction of classical object detection in pytorch. (For own study and based on others' implement)

### Done

- [x] [SSD: Single Shot MultiBox Detector](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325)
- [x] [YOLO v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08242)

Noteï¼šthe implement is mainly based on the [amdegroot's ssd](https://github.com/amdegroot/ssd.pytorch).
